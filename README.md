A few wise words:
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break rules.
Practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently - Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one -- perferebaly one -- obvious way to do it.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
IF implimentation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
Namespaces are cool, more of those.
